# Project-Video-Free-Form-Completion
A demo project on implementing SC-FEGAN in video free form completion. 

[suspend before fully done. May restart in the future.]
## Configuration
- A pre-trained HED reimplemented via Pytorch is required to generate
the sketch of image. We copy the HED from https://github.com/moabitcoin/holy-edge/tree/master/hed
and place it in `Toolkit/`.
